During the past seven days, how much did eye problems affect your ability to do your regular daily activities, other than work at a
job?
By regular activities, we mean the usual activities you do, such as work around the house, shopping, childcare, exercising,
studying, etc. Think about times you were limited in the amount or kind of activities you could do and times you accomplished
less than you would like. If eye problems affected your activities only a little, choose a low number. Choose a high number if eye
problems affected your activities a great deal.
Consider only how much eye problems affected your ability to do your regular daily activities, other than work at a job.
